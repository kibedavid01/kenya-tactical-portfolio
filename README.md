# 🇰🇪 NSE Alpha Journal – Tactical Portfolio Intelligence

Welcome to my personal NSE Alpha Journal — a daily, high-discipline log of investment decisions, market updates, and macro-driven stock picks for the **Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)**.

This project is designed to:
- Build a **public track record of execution and insight**
- Showcase a **macro-informed, high-conviction investing strategy**
- Post daily **stock intelligence and rebalance decisions**
- Identify **undervalued opportunities** across Defensive, Growth, Value, Speculative, and Dividend Income categories

## 💼 Portfolio Thesis

Kenya’s macro environment (CBK policy, inflation, political shocks, sectoral dynamics) drives much of the risk/reward across listed equities.

I treat the NSE like an emerging market hedge fund manager:
- Monitor news flows + macro trends daily
- Assign scores to valuation, sentiment, and earnings risk
- Take tactical positions based on relative value and behavioral signals
- Focus on **alpha**, not just passive exposure
