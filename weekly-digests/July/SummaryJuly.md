## 🔍 Key Holding Rationale

### **SCOM (20%) – The Digital Monopoly**
- **Why:** 92% mobile money share, Ethiopia scaling, ROE 39.2%
- **Catalyst:** Ethiopia EBITDA breakeven (Q1 FY26)
- **Risk:** Regulatory pressure on M-Pesa margins

### **KCB, EQUITY, COOP, DTBK, ABSA (44%) – The OTC Play**
- **Why:** CBK’s interbank rate pivot + OTC market maker role = **liquidity premium**
- **Yield + Value + Policy** = triple alpha
- **Top foreign buys in banking sector**

### **BAT (7%) – The Yield Anchor**
- **Why:** 13.7% dividend yield, 25.7% ROE, defensive
- **Hold, not add:** Limited capital appreciation

### **EABL (6%) – The Recovery Watch**
- **Why:** Strong PAT (+12%), but dividend cut → retail panic
- **Hold for:** Recovery in premium beer demand, FX gains
- **Trim if:** PAT growth slows or input costs rise

### **KENGEN (8%) – The Green Asymmetry**
- **Why:** 8.4% yield, green bond catalyst, power deficit
- **Target:** 9.50 by Q1 2026 (+29.1%)
- **Low P/E (7.5x), high optionality**

## 📉 Underperformers & Watchlist

| Ticker | Issue | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| **EABL** | Dividend cut, retail exit | Hold → monitor Q1 FY26 |
| **NSE** | Low growth, high P/E | Hold as structural play |
| **BAT** | Yield trap, limited upside | Hold for income |

---

## 🚀 Forward Strategy (August 2025)

| Focus | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Double Down on Banks** | Add KCB, COOP, DTBK on dips |
| **Accumulate KENGEN** | Target 7.00–7.50 for 8–10% allocation |
| **Hold SCOM** | No sell signal; Ethiopia inflection near |
| **Monitor EABL** | Watch for volume recovery and dividend stability |
| **Avoid Micro-Caps** | No liquidity, no catalysts (UCHM, CIC, ARM) |

## 🧠 David Kibe’s Edge

> **“I don’t chase momentum. I position for policy, yield, and structural change.”**

This portfolio is built on:
1. **Policy Alpha:** OTC reform → bank re-rating
2. **Yield Discipline:** Only stocks with >7% real yield
3. **Governance Filter:** No state-linked, low-transparency plays
4. **Foreign Flow Alignment:** We follow the smart money

---

## ✅ Final Positioning

- **Core Engine:** Banking (44%) + Telecom (20%)
- **Income Pillars:** COOP, DTBK, BAT (24.3% of portfolio)
- **Asymmetric Bets:** KENGEN, SCOM
- **Cash Buffer:** 5% for KPC IPO or SCOM/EABL dip

You’re not diversified for the sake of it.  
You’re **concentrated where the edge is**.
