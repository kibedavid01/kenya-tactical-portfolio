Today’s News Highlights
• World Bank freezes Sh97bn to Kenya on reform delays
 The World Bank Group has withheld disbursement of a Sh96.93 billion ($750 million) loan to Kenya over delays in implementing agreed reforms, including the passing of a Bill to curb conflict of interest involving politicians and public officials. The lending, which was expected this month after an initial delay, was to be done through an instrument called a Development Policy Operations (DPO) loan, which commits Kenya to instituting reforms aimed at creating fiscal space and improving governance. Besides the Conflict of Interest Bill, Kenya was expected to adopt a single bank account for public finances and automation of government tenders to eliminate collusion, insider dealings and fixing contracts. The Treasury had budgeted for the World Bank billions in the year starting July, when it didn’t factor in funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The freeze on the World Bank funding could see the Treasury increase borrowings amid the ballooning public debt or cut spending to plug the budget hole. 
• State firm defaults on China loan with Sh2.8bn idle in bank
A State agency has defaulted on a Chinese loan despite some idle Sh2.8 billion sitting in its bank account at KCB Group, exposing taxpayers to hefty penalties and a credit rating downgrade. The Auditor-General has revealed that the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (Rerec) has been deducted a paltry Sh1,179 from the account created to settle a Sh13.6 billion loan advanced by the Exim Bank of China. The government in 2015 took the loan to construct a 50MW solar power plant in Garissa County, which sold 84GWh of electricity for Sh675 million to Kenya Power in the year to June 2024. 
•  Complaints against telcos surge 28pc
Complaints against telcos and broadcasters surged 28.5 percent in the year ended June 30, 2025, signalling dwindling quality of services and increased violations of consumer rights. Analysis of data from the Communications Authority (CA) shows that consumers filed 914 cases on various breaches in the period under review, compared to 711 in the year that ended June 2024. The surge has put service providers on the spot amid mounting calls on the companies to improve the quality of service on their network and uphold client rights. Consumers filed 186 cases against broadcasters in the period ended June 2025, compared to none the previous year, making them the biggest driver of the increase in all complaints lodged with the communications watchdog. 
• Nigeria topples Kenya as Shelter Afrique’s biggest shareholder
Kenya has been displaced by Nigeria as the largest shareholder in Pan-African housing financier Shelter Afrique Development Bank (ShafDB). Nigeria increased its shareholding to 17.06 percent last year following a Sh663 million ($5.14 million) capital injection as Kenya sat out. Kenya was previously the largest shareholder in the Nairobi headquartered development bank since 2017 with a 15.86 percent stake.
• Ruto sets September deadline for KPC listing
 The government will sell part of its stake in Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) and list the firm on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) before September this year, President William Ruto has said. Dr Ruto yesterday said the structuring of the initial public offering (IPO) was being finalised by the Privatisation Commission before being presented to the Cabinet for approval. In an IPO, a company raises additional capital from new investors and part of its shares are made available for trading on the exchange. The Privatisation Commission is expected to structure the details of the IPO which include the pricing of the offer. Listing of KPC will mark the first privatisation of a government entity through the securities exchange in 17 years, the last being Safaricom’s IPO in 2008. “We are implementing a structured time bound divestiture programme starting with the listing of the KPC,” Dr Ruto said yesterday during the listing of the bond backed by the Talanta stadium.
