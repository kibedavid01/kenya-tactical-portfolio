## 🎯 Tactical Portfolio Actions

| Ticker | Action | Rationale |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **KCB** | ✅ Add | Direct beneficiary of interbank rate pricing + OTC market maker role |
| **COOP** | ✅ Add | High yield, depositor base aligned with SACCO investors; OTC play |
| **EBS** | ✅ Buy | P/B 0.71x, strong retail funding, likely OTC liquidity provider |
| **SCOM** | ✅ Hold | Momentum intact; foreign inflows continue |
| **BAT** | ✅ Hold | Capital defense strong; yield still above T-bill |
| **EABL** | ❌ Maintain Exit | No recovery in demand; input cost pressure persists |

---

## 📊 Suggested Allocation (Post-Trade)

| Category | Allocation (%) |
|--------|----------------|
| Defensive | 25% |
| Growth | 18% |
| Value | 28% |
| Dividend Income | 22% |
| Speculative | 7% |

> *Rebalanced: +5% from EABL to KCB/COOP/EBS*

## ⚠️ Risk Dashboard
- **CBK Policy Shift:** Interbank rate = new loan benchmark → **bullish for banks**
- **OTC Market Launch:** Top 10 banks to be market makers → **liquidity premium**
- **SACCO Dominance:** 27% investor preference → **COOP, KCB benefit from trust transfer**
- **Moody’s Warning:** Forex reserves at risk → **avoid USD debt, favor exporters**
- **Irish FDI Shift:** East Africa focus → **long-term SCOM, KENGEN, NSE infrastructure plays**

---

## 📈 Price Triggers (Next 5 Trading Days)
- **KCB > 29.50** = Breakout confirmation
- **COOP > 13.00** = Institutional entry signal
- **EBS > 15.00** = OTC designation odds rise
- **SCOM > 27.50** = Ethiopia momentum building

---

## 🧠 Execution Notes
- **Front-run OTC designation list:** Overweight banks with strong interbank activity (KCB, COOP, EBS, DTBK)
- **Use SACCO trust as behavioral proxy:** Retail investors “migrate” to formal banks with similar branding
- **Avoid bond-heavy insurers (CIC):** OTC shift favors banks, not insurers
- **Monitor CBK’s final OTC guidelines (expected Aug 5)**

---

## 🔄 Next Watchlist
- **KCB, COOP, EBS:** Potential OTC market maker designation
- **SCOM:** Ethiopia subscriber data (early Aug)
- **KENGEN:** Green bond closing (Q3 2025)
- **Moody’s next Kenya review:** September 2025
