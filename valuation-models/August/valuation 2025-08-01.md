## 🧠 David Kibe’s Edge

> **“The market punished exporters — but rewarded those who benefit from policy and payout growth.”**

- **EABL’s dividend hike** is a **governance signal** — capital return is back
- **KPC IPO** is a **structural catalyst** — NSE, SCOM, banks win
- **US tariffs** hurt exporters — but **BAT, EABL, KCB benefit from import substitution**
- **Foreign inflows confirm** — smart money is scaling in

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

**August playbook is clear:**

- ✅ **Buy EABL** — dividend growth changes the narrative
- ✅ **Add NSE** — IPO beneficiary, momentum strong
- ✅ **Hold SCOM, KCB, EQUITY, COOP, BAT**
- ✅ **Accumulate KENGEN** on green bond news
- ❌ **Avoid exporters** (Kakuzi, Williamson, Kapchorua)

You’re not reacting.  
You’re **front-running the next wave of alpha**.
