## 🧠 David Kibe’s Edge

> **“The market sold the news, but the smart money bought the dip — in the right stocks.”**

- **EABL cut its dividend** → retail panic → **but fundamentals are intact**
- **Foreigners bought SCOM, EQUITY, KENGEN** → **they’re pricing the OTC and green bond catalysts**
- **DTBK, COOP, KCB** are **yield + value + policy plays** — triple threat

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

**Focus on the core, exploit the panic.**

- ✅ **Buy:** SCOM, KCB, EQUITY, COOP, DTBK
- ✅ **Accumulate:** KENGEN
- ⚠️ **Hold:** EABL (for recovery)
- ❌ **Avoid:** Micro-caps, state-linked bond plays

The **blue-chip toll road is open**.  
We’re in the fast lane.
