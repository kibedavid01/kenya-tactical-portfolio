---

## 🔍 Framework Overview

This valuation strategy blends intrinsic metrics, macroeconomic filters, and behavioral indicators to assess tactical buy/sell signals across NSE-listed equities.

---

### 1. 📉 Intrinsic Value Reference (DCF, Yield)

Used as conceptual anchor where financial data is robust.

- **Dividend-focused stocks** (BAT, COOP, KENGEN) are benchmarked to 91-day T-bill (currently ~9.72%)
- Target yield spread: **+5% above T-bill**

| Ticker | Est. Yield (%) | Spread vs T-bill | Comment                  |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| BAT    | ~10.0          | +0.28%           | Slightly above bond proxy |
| COOP   | ~9.5           | -0.22%           | Slight miss, still strong |
| KENGEN | ~8.7           | -1.02%           | Capital gain offset helps |

### 3. 🌐 Macro-Market Adjustments

**Policy Drivers:**

- **Fuel Inflation:** Depleting subsidy → CPI surge likely
- **Development Cuts:** ↓ Jobs = bearish for discretionary consumer equities
- **Bond Market Shift:** OTC favoring banks → top-tier financials preferred
- **Retail Retreat:** Institutional dominance = smart money signal

---

### 4. 💹 Behavioral & Flow Triggers

- **Foreign Buy Surge:** Safaricom, BAT – confirms institutional appetite
- **Retail Fade:** Watch liquidity risk in micro caps (e.g., CIC, Uchumi)
- **Volume Leaders:** KENGEN, CRWN showing accumulation
- **OTC Bond News:** Banks to benefit — overweight large-cap lenders

---

## 🔁 Adjustments Made Today

- **Raised Weight on SCOM, CRWN**: Breakout patterns + foreign participation  
- **Reduced EABL Exposure**: Weak price momentum, net outflows, inflation risk  
- **Confirmed BAT Buy**: Despite muted spread, capital defense remains intact
