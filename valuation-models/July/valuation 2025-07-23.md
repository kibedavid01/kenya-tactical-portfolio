# 📊 Valuation Methodology for NSE Alpha Portfolio

This tactical portfolio combines intrinsic valuation, relative pricing, macro context, and behavioral analysis to build an optimized edge on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE).

---

## 🔍 1. Intrinsic Valuation: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
We reference DCF to evaluate if long-term free cash flow justifies market prices — especially for underfollowed or mispriced counters.

- Used for: SCAN, KENGEN (when analyst estimates exist)
- Note: Kenya lacks consistent analyst coverage → DCF used conceptually, not always numerically

---

## 🔗 2. Relative Valuation

### 📈 Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
- Used for value plays with strong earnings
- Example: **KCB** trades at ~3.5x P/E vs peer avg of ~7–9x → undervalued

### 📊 Price-to-Sales (P/S)
- Used for companies with inconsistent or negative earnings
- Example: **SCAN** trades at a deep discount to revenue peers

### 📚 Price-to-Book (P/B)
- Highlights asset-heavy undervaluation or distress
- Example: SCAN trades at ~0.25x book value → deep value/speculative

### 💸 Dividend Yield vs T-Bill Rate
- Used to screen for income plays with excess yield vs fixed-income
- Benchmark: Target >5% spread over 91-day Treasury Bill

---

## 🧠 3. Macro-Fundamental Overlay

Valuations are adjusted for:
- **CBK interest rates and monetary policy**
- **Inflation / fuel subsidy policy**
- **Currency risk and forex trends**
- **Political and regulatory shifts (e.g., Kuscco collapse, CBK tender scandal)**

Example: Banking sector weighed against youth flight to mobile wallets, Kuscco risk.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Behavioral + Price Action Triggers

We monitor:
- RSI trends
- Momentum breakouts
- Historical resistance/support levels

Examples:
- **SCOM > KES 28.00** = add trigger  
- **BAT < KES 400** = value accumulation zone  
- **CRWN > KES 42.00** = breakout momentum play
