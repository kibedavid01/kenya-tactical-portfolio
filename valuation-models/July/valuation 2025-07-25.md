This file outlines the layered valuation framework used to guide equity selection, trimming, and tactical rotation decisions within the NSE Tactical Alpha Portfolio.

## 🔍 1. Intrinsic Valuation (DCF Lens)

> **Usage**: For under-followed or cash-flow driven companies like SCAN and KENGEN

- **Free Cash Flow Estimation**: Based on historical EBIT margins, capex levels, and inflation-adjusted sales growth.
- **Discount Rate**: CBK rate (9.6%) + Equity Risk Premium (7.5%) → ~17.1% WACC proxy
- **Terminal Growth**: 3–4% assumed for utility-like firms

⚠️ **Note**: DCF applied qualitatively, due to unreliable forecasting data in Kenya’s listed micro/small caps.

## 📈 2. Relative Valuation Metrics

### 🔹 Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
- **KCB**: Trading ~3.5x vs sector avg 8x → undervalued
- **EABL**: >20x = overvalued vs cash yield

### 🔹 Price-to-Book (P/B)
- **SCAN**: ~0.25x → distressed asset deep value

### 🔹 Price-to-Sales (P/S)
- For firms with negative EPS or cyclical margin swings

### 🔹 Dividend Yield vs Treasury Spread
- 91-day T-bill yield as of July 2025: **8.13%**
- Portfolio rule: Equity dividend yield must exceed **13%+** to justify income allocation

---

## 🌍 3. Macro-Behavioral Overlay

### 🏦 CBK Policy Rate & Yield Curve
- Rediscount window (bond floor) at **CBK rate + 3%** → ~12.6% minimum hurdle

### 🛢️ Inflation Trends
- Fuel subsidy removal = rising transport costs
- Equity preference shifts toward cash-flow positive dividend payers

### 🧠 Behavioral Triggers
- RSI momentum (CRWN >42.00 = breakout)
- Support/Resistance breakouts (SCOM >28.00)
- IPO euphoria (NSE ahead of KPC listing)

## ✅ Summary
The portfolio applies a hybrid valuation model blending discounted cash flow logic, relative pricing ratios, macro policy overlays (CBK-driven), and behavioral market signals. All equities must clear multiple hurdles: yield, macro compatibility, and technical entry timing.

**Valuation is not static. It is context-aware and continuously updated.**
