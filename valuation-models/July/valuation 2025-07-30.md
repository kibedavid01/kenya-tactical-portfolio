## 🧠 David Kibe’s Edge: Today’s Insight

> **“The CBK didn’t just change a rate — it handed pricing power back to banks. That’s re-rating territory.”**

We’re not just valuing stocks.  
We’re **pricing policy**.

- **KCB, COOP, EBS** are no longer just cheap banks.  
  They’re **liquidity architects** in the new OTC era.  
- **SACCO dominance** isn’t nostalgia — it’s **behavioral capital waiting to formalize**.  
- **KENGEN** isn’t just a utility — it’s a **green infrastructure play with yield**.

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

**The banking sector re-rating has begun.**  
The **smart money is moving**.  
We are positioned.

- ✅ **Buy:** KCB, COOP, EBS  
- ✅ **Hold:** SCOM, BAT  
- ✅ **Accumulate:** KENGEN  
- ❌ **Exit:** EABL

Hold with conviction. Add on dips. Avoid the noise.
